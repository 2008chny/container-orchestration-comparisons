#Cluster Setup

##The challenge:

- Create a cluster with three "worker" nodes
  - If the cluster manager requires a master, that must also be set up
- Must be able to securely connect to the cluster from a computer not on the same network (i.e over the internet)
- Add a worker node to the cluster
- Drain and Delete worker node from the cluster
